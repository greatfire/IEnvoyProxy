# IEnvoyProxy Changlog

## 3.0.0
- Took over complete rewrite of IPtProxy:
  - Got rid of patches and the goptlib interface.
  - Instead, have our own unified code which creates transports using Lyrebird and Snowflake as dependencies.
  - Structured with classes now instead of global functions.
  - Improved interface:
    - When `#start` returns, it's now safe to use the transport.
    - `#start` will throw errors if something's wrong.
    - Callback for when transport stopped. (PTs only!)
  - Added TubeSocks, V2Ray and Hysteria 2 support to `Controller`.
- Updated Snowflake to v2.10.1.
- Updated Lyrebird to v0.5.0.

## 2.0.1
- Fixed weird mixup of obfs4Port and obfs4TubesocksPort. Properly expose all correctly.

## 2.0.0
